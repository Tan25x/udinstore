- Background color: Dark grey (#13141A), nearly the same hue as the primary but heavily desaturated for a modern feel appropriate to the request for 'dark mode'.
- Accent color: Pink (#D9289F) to provide contrast against the dark background; analogous to the primary and highly saturated, to convey excitement.
- Font: 'Space Grotesk', a modern sans-serif, to be used for all headings and body text.
- Use high-quality SVG icons from https://flowbite.com/illustrations/, with line art.
- Implement entrance animations and section transitions to improve user experience
- Use neumorphic glows and liquid glass visuals for a modern glassmorphism style.
